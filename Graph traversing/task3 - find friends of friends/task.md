# Find friends of friends

Write a code that returns all friends' names (`firstName` property) of friends of the person by given the first name.

Note that, by definition, the start vertex is also one of the end vertices querying friends of friends.

<div class="hint">After traversing to the vertex (by using the out method for example) you can traverse deeper by using another method (like both, in, out, etc).</div>

<div class="hint">To remove duplicates you can use the dedup method..</div>
