# Task 2 - find friends of friends

Write a code that return's all friends names (`firstName` property) of friends of the person by given the first name.

Note that, by definition, the start vertex is also one of the end vertices querying friends of friends.

<div class="hint">After traversing to the vertex (by using the out method for example) you can traverse deeper by using another method (like both, in, out, etc).</div>
